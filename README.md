1. Provide two ideas of a program you can create to help CodeCrew and list two benefits of each one.

1st Idea: A program that logs monthly points for students and sends notifications and/or notices when their points are behind. The benefit of this program takes a little responsibility off of Erin, and it's less time consuming. 

2nd Idea: A program that allows students to clock in and clock out for attendance. This would so take some pressure off of Erin and would provide a better and more accurate log for points.
